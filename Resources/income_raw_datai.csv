"1 A margin of error (MOE) is a measure of an estimate's variability. The larger the MOE in relation to the size of the estimate, the less reliable the estimate. This number, when added to and subtracted from the estimate, forms the 90 percent confidence interval.

"30 Since Hispanic individuals may be any race, data in this report for the Hispanic population overlap with data for race groups. Of those who reported only one race, Hispanic origin was reported by 16.7 percent of White householders, 5.9 percent of Black householders, 2.7 percent of Asian householders, and 33.4 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native householders. Data users should exercise caution when interpreting aggregate results for the Hispanic population or for race groups because these populations consist of many distinct groups that differ in socioeconomic characteristics, culture, and nativity. Data were first collected for Hispanic individuals in 1972 and for Asian and Pacific Islander individuals in 1987.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
